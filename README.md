Natural vim
===========

Natural vim is a set of defaults that I believe makes more sense than
what comes shipped with vim. If you strongly disagree with any of these,
please feel free to file an issue.


Quick notes
-----------

* Backup
All projects I'm involved in use some kind of vc. Darcs, git or svn and
with that comes backup and since every other developer I know also use vcÂ´s
I've decided to turn off backup.
* .exrc
.exrc is enabled, but with the secure option. That means not all operations
can be executed from .exrc, just a little gotcha.
