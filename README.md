Natural vim
===========

Natural vim is a set of defaults that I believe makes more sense than
what comes shipped with vim. If you strongly disagree with any of these,
please feel free to file an issue.


Quick notes
-----------

* Backup and swap is stored to ~/.vim/x
* .exrc is enabled with the secure option
* :vb to open a buffer in vertical split
* Navigation by row instead of line
* Consistent yank behavior
* Simple and global regexes by default
