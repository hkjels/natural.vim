# Natural.vim

`Natural.vim` is a set of defaults that I believe makes more sense than
what comes shipped with vim. If you strongly disagree with any of these,
please feel free to file an issue or simply don't bother using it.


## Quick notes

* Backup and swap is stored to ~/.vim/\(backup|swap\)
* Much more history to work with
* Keeps your cursor-position when switching buffers; yay!
* :vb to open a buffer in vertical split
* Navigation by row instead of line
* Consistent yank behavior
* Simple and global regexes by default


## Installation

I recommend the use of [NeoBundle](//github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) to
install.

```vim
NeoBundle 'hkjels/natural.vim'
```
